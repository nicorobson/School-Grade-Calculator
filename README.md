# School-Grade-Calculator
An interactive Python program which takes user input, and computes the user's final grade in a given course. This is particularly useful for me during exams, so I can see what grade I need on my exam to achieve my desired mark in the course.

# How To Use
Simply install Python on your machine, and run grade_calculator.py in a terminal or capable text editor (eg. Visual Studio).
